### Known issues

#### Tool crashes after picking a directory
If the tool crashes after picking a directory there are two things you can try:
- use a short and simple path as the root folder, for example C:\assets\PVGames. Inside of it you can have sub folders per category as you wish. The problem is that the file paths currently can't exceed ~256 characters.
This is an example folder setup:
![alt text](images/RpgTools_FolderSetup.png "Folder Setup")

- don't use any non-ascii characters in your path : For example don't use letters like "æ± " and better use common characters to be sure.

- Avoid manual modifications of filenames from PVGames assets : The tool searches files using the PVGames naming conventions. If you rename files / add files to character directories it might confuse the alorithm which analyzes everything.

## Tools

There are several tools inside the RpgTools executable. The two main tools (Character Creator and Level Editor) can be used with any engine you want, the other tools are mostly meant to be used if you want to use this engine to create your game.

### Character Creator

With the Character Creator you can choose between all the units the tool has found in the folder(s) you added. You can view animations, configure custom equipment, configure custom colors and other things.
You can save/load the character configurations using json files so you can easily manage multiple characters.
Also you can export characters with various options to sprite sheets or export sprite frames.
