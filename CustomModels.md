# Custom models

## Overview
Rpg Tools includes a simple naming convention you can use for your own characters.

### Rpg Tools naming scheme
The naming scheme is `[CharacterName]_[AnimationName]_[Frames]x[Directions].png`

As an example if you have a character called `Dwarf` with sprite sheets consisting of 8 directions(one row per direction) you can use filenames like that:
`Dwarf_Idle01_5x8.png`

The tool should then automatially treat this as a charater animation.
