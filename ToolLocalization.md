# Tool Localization

The tool can completely be localized. To create new localizations you can execute the following steps:

- Download and launch POEdit
- Choose File->New from POT/PO File
- Select the file `\internationalization\locales\rpg_tools.pot`
- Localize all entries
- Choose File->Compile to MO and choose the correct folder for the localiation, e.g. `locales\de\LC_MESSAGES` for the german localization.
